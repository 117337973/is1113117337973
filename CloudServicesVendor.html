                This is a way of delivering applications over the internet - as a service. Cloud computing allows firms to use computing rescources as a utility, just like they do with gas, water, electricity, etc. Before the rise of cloud computing, businesses could only buy and rely on packaged software. The old method is far too unreliable, costly and time consuming.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                With SaaS, you are paying for a system that is ready to use, as it is installed, maintained, upgraded and kept secure by the vendor. All that is left for the customers is to adapt their businesses to using a cloud-based service.

                PaaS is a cloud computing model in which a third-party provider delivers hardware and software tools - usualy those needed for application development - to users over the internet. A great example of PaaS is the Cloud9 integrated development environment (IDE).
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The Cloud9 IDE lets you write, run and debug your code with just a browser. A code editor, debugger and terminal is included in the program. It comes pre-packaged with essential tools for popular programming languages so there is no need to install files or configure your development machine to start new projects. Since the IDE is cloud based, you can work on your projects from anywhere on any machine as long as there is a browser and an internet connection.

                Amazon Web Services (AWS) is an example of Iaas. IaaS contains the basic building blocks for cloud IT and generally provide access to networking features, computers and data storage space. IaaS provides you with the highest level of flexibility and management control over your IT rescources.

                CaaS is part of a larger category of services known as software as a service (SaaS), in which vendors offer software products and services over the Internet. Google offer an electronic mailing service (e-mail) called Gmail. 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Gmail is a fast and convenient way for users to communicate with each other. It facilitates the sending of messages and attatchments. Once an account is created, it can be accessed again from any machine as long as there is an internet connection.
